wdR Contribution
================

Overview
--------
wdR Contribution is a contribution and forum participation tracker, for the online web development community: webDevRefinery (.com)

On a daily basis, a script crawls the posts and user profile pages of the forum, recording how many new posts, reputation points (rep), and logins for that day have taken place. These results are stored in a database before being graphed and tabled in an easy to read format, complete with rankings, and a point system.

Features
--------
* A crawler which records all new post, reputation, and login counts
* A front end which displays this information in a tabular way
* A bot which posts to the forum on the first day of every month with general statistics from the previous month
* A basic signature generation system
