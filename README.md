wdR Contribution
================

Overview
--------
As suggested by TheMaster in the old thread, here is a new rerun of the
top contributing wdR members based off of post counts and reputation 
ratios.
 
I rewrote ianonavy's script in PHP because I don't know Python and it
was a fun coding challenge.

Features
--------
Two scripts, one which generates a list of the most helpful and active users, and one which generates a "signature image" to show off your forum participation skills ;)

TODO
----
Include more stats in the signature image.
Add custom font support to signature script.
Include custom background importing in signature script.

Thanks to:
----------
ianonavy for the original concept and Python script.
Solf_Wolf for the PHP rewrite and cleanup, as well as repository creation.
TheMaster for signature image generation script.
